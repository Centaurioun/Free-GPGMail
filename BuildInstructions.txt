This was built with Xcode 10.0. Command line build tools must be installed.

(1) Go to the Source directory and run: make

This should produce two mailbundles in the Source directory: GPGMail_3.mailbundle and GPGMail_4.mailbundle

(2) Copy the latest mailbundle to your user-specific Mail Bundle directory

mkdir -p ~/Library/Mail/Bundles/
cp -r Source/GPGMail_4.mailbundle ~/Library/Mail/Bundles/

(3) Restart Mail.app, go to Preferences -> General -> Manage Plugins.  You should see the plugin, enable it and click Apply and Restart Mail.

Hopefully it's working for you now.
